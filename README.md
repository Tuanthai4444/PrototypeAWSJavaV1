# AWS_Learning_Aid
This is the first prototype of EduScribe, this prototype was scrapped
due to the capabilities that the latest version of EduScribe
allows for with the usage of AWS Java Version 2 SDK. There is
some code overlap due to the usage of AWS Java Version 1 SDK
having superior transfer management and transfer polling 
however overall, I did a swap from the AmazonS3 builders
towards the S3Client builders.
